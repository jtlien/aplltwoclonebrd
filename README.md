An apple II clone board in kicad 
I needed a good source of documentation for the Apple II clone board that I had bought back in the early 1980s.   It wat in my closet for about 40 years and I recently wanted to get it out to get it to work and could not find a good source of documentation in an up to date CAD system.   So I made this design which represents to the best of my knowledge the original apple 2 clone board that I had.
As of Fall/2021, I have a fairly complete schemtic, chip layout and the start of a routed board in KICAD.    This may also be convenient for people building or working on vintage apple II hardware to use some of the nice KICAD tools like iBom to populate their boards etc.    Plus the design rule checkers should they get to the point of building a board.   My own plans are possibly to build a four layer board, with only a +5 Volt supply (-5v can be generated by a buck converter chip).
+12 and -12 Volts were needed for old serial ports and are not used much anymore.
